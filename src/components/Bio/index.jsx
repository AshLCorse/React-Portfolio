              programmer and developer. The skills she learned here are
              showcased on her portfolio. Her path led to further study in
              Javascript, including frameworks such as Next.js, Vue.js,
              Svelte.js, Nuxt.js, and Angular. She\â€™s done multiple training
              sessions through Udemy, Khan Academy, and LinkedIn Learning. She
              now offers custom websites and web apps, in addition to other
              programming solutions. She values creating a sense of community in
